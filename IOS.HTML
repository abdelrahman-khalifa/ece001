        <h1> What Is The iOS Operating System?
</h1>
        <p>IOS is the operating system developed by apple.inc company. iOS runs on all of Apple’s mobile devices. IOS is the second-largest operating system worldwide after Android.</p>
    <p>IOS uses a multi-touch interface in which the device is operated with the help of simple texture. Simple gestures such as swapping fingers on top of the device’s screen. Which can be worked on by moving to the next patch. And pinching with your finger to zoom the screen. You can do all this work freely on iOS.</p>
   <h2>History of iOS OS: -</h2>
    <p>In 2005, when Steve Jobs started planning for the iPhone, he had two options, the first being to shrink the Mac. This is the Macintosh desktop of Apple company and the second was to enlarge the iPod. To solve this problem, they met the team that made the Mac and iPod and then decided to make iOS for iPhone.

History Of iOS OS
The new operating system was released with the iPhone in 2006 January. The operating system was named iPhone OS at the time of the iPhone release. Initially, no third-party apps were allowed to run in the device in the iPhone OS. Steve Job’s idea was that application developers can develop web apps through the Safari web browser. So that iPhone depends on web apps. Which will behave like native apps?
What Is The Android?
In October 2008, Apple announced an original software development kit under development for SD. And it was planned to put February in the hands of the developer. On March 8, 2007, the iPhone SD was ready. And it was announced. IOS Apps store opened on 10 July 2007. In which initially there were only 500 applications. But from September 2007 to 2014, its number had increased to 2.2 million. These apps were collectively downloaded over 130 billion times. This was a big deal? In September 2008, Apple announced the iPod, followed by an iPad in January 2010 that had a larger screen than the iPhone and iPod. This was designed for web browsing media consumption and reading?
In June 2010, Apple changed the iPhone OS to iOS. Earlier Apple’s operating system could not handle more programs of iPhones. So I was forced to create a new operating system IOS. Apple’s iOS is currently the main software. Which runs on all models of iPhone, iPad iPod touch and iPad mini mobile devices. And the same software works on Apple’s smartwatch. Whenever Apple adds any new features to iOS, it is called a software update.</p>
